    <h1> Hi, this is me, Marcus Timothy Ureta!</h1>
    <p> Currently right now, I am a Grade 11 student in CIIT SHS learning Computer Science. I am very enthusiastic about learning how to code. Everyday I strive to do better and learn more, so follow along with my portofolio site!</p>
    <p> In this website, I'm going to show off all my accomplishments I've done within my time in CIIT. Whilst granted they might not be the most impressive projects, I'm proud of them because they made me who I am today.</p>

    <h2> My Achievements</h1>
    <p><a href="index_two.html"> Here is a site I made to practice coding! </a></p>
    <p> <a href="https://github.com/PinGEm?tab=repositories"> And here is my entire github page! To show off all my C# works</a></p>
    <p> <a href="https://pingem.itch.io/marshmallow-boy">Here's a small game I'm working on as well if you want to check it out! I'm still currently developing it however but I've gone far enough to show progress.</a></p>
